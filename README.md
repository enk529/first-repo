<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does TextMate2 convert markdown with IDs?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It seems like headers are the only(?) elements that get IDs when converting to HTML. This does make sense, especially if one wants to have specific headers styled in different ways. However, there should also be a way to set custom ID names for existing CSS.</p>
